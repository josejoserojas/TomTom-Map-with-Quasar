# MyMaps (mymaps)

Hey TomTom Developers!  adding a map into my Quasar app was very easy! Now I want to add more functionalities like getting more info from the POIs I click on, or routing to a location from my current GPS position automatically... any other ideas?

The video of tis tutorial is here: https://youtu.be/w7f969zWbVE

Thank you for reading and Happy Mapping!
